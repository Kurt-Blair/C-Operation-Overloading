Game of Pig by Kurt Blair

Java program made using JOptionpane to play the Game of Pig against the computer

The rules of the game are:

The first player to accumulate a score of 100 wins.
The human goes first.
After one roll, a player has the choice to "hold" or to roll again.
You roll two dice. Certain conditions apply:
If both dice are ones, then your turn is over and your accumulated score is set to zero (ouch!).
If one dice is one, then your turn is over and your turn score is set to zero.
If both dice match ("doubles") then you must roll again.
For any other dice combination, you just add the dice total to your turn score and you have the choice of rolling again.
When your turn is over, either through your choice or you rolled a one, then your turn sum is added to your accumulated score.

My grade was an A- on this assigment.
